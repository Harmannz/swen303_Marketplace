    <!-- Angular has directives with most often start with ng-
        Here, ng-model ties the value of the input field to the $scope.text
        property - this is 2 way binding in action -->

    <!-- You can see that when you change the value in the input field,
        since it is bound to text, it changes the text in this h5 -->
